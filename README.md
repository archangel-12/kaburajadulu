# KaburAjaDulu

KaburAjaDulu is an open-source platform helping Indonesians explore study and work opportunities abroad. Our mission is to provide accessible, accurate information and build a supportive community for those seeking international education and career paths.

## 🚀 Mission & Vision

We believe that international experience can transform lives and open new horizons. Our platform aims to:

- **Share job opportunities** - Find insider information about companies for referrals. This is crucial, as not all job openings are publicly advertised.
- **Language learning** - Access expert advice from those who have already gone abroad, including tips and preparation guidance.
- **Scholarship sharing** - Discover opportunities for studying abroad through scholarships and financial aid programs.
- **Expert mentorship** - Learn from experienced individuals who have successfully navigated international education and career paths.
